	<p>We build intangible products here at the Shreddhed Development Workshop: personalized websites, graphics, and custom templates to name a few. We pride ourselves in that there is no framework or language so intimidating that we won't give it a shot. Angular js, bootstrap, PHP, Atom, and Blender are some of our current favorite tools, but we are open to using others. Customer satisfaction is our highest priority here at Shreddhed, so don't hesitate to contact us at any time for any reason.</p>
