	<p>The Shreddhed Development Workshop traces its humble beginnings to a hectic autumn afternoon in Robert Harding's computer lab: <strong>four</strong> linguistics students at UNM wanted a temporary website they could use to pool study questions and answers and <strong>twelve</strong> students wound up using the amateur Wordpress site thrown together during that fateful half-hour. That temporary website was Shreddhed's first project and we've remained open to projects ever since. We specialize in websites designed with the Angular framework and we utilize tools such as Bootstrap. Customer satisfaction is our highest priority here at Shreddhed, so don't hesitate to contact us at any time for any reason.</p>
